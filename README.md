# Shell Game React

Shell Game React is a simple game app that allows the player to play rounds of Shell Game by choosing 1 of the 3 existing nutshells via a cursor click. When the player has chosen a nutshell, the game alerts them with a notification that states whether or not they chose the correct nutshell. After the alert, the game page refreshes with a new order of nutshells.

If the correct nutshell is chosen, the player's new score is logged and saved via the browser's local storage. If the incorrect nutshell is chosen, the player loses and their score is set to 0.
